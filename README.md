## Project Name: KunJon Weather App

**Overview:**
The KunJon Weather App is a Next.js project that leverages the OpenWeather API to retrieve and present weather data for various cities. The project encompasses several essential features, including the setup of the API, definition of interfaces for data exchange, making external requests, displaying images, and styling pages using Tailwind CSS.

1. Setting up a third-party API:

   - Following registration with the OpenWeather API, we obtained an API key and verified its functionality using the cURL command.
   - In Next.js, we securely store API keys in the .env file to ensure privacy and security.

2. Defining interfaces:

   - To ensure robust data integrity, we implemented TypeScript and employed interfaces to define consistent structures for city and weather data.
   - By leveraging TypeScript interfaces, we achieved stronger typing and improved code organization.

3. Making external requests:

   - Given the Weather App's reliance on OpenWeather data, we implemented a mechanism to make external service requests.
   - We adopted sequential data fetching to retrieve up-to-date weather information for different cities, ensuring accurate data representation.

4. Displaying images:

   - For visual representation of weather conditions, we utilized the Image component provided by Next.js.
   - Leveraging this component, we gained access to additional features not available with a standard `<img>` tag.
   - In cases where the image originates from an external domain, we emphasize the importance of additional whitelisting measures for security purposes.

5. Styling pages with Tailwind:
   - To enhance the aesthetics and layout of the Weather App, we harnessed the power of Tailwind CSS.
   - By leveraging various styles and utilities offered by Tailwind, we achieved clean and visually appealing page designs.

The Weather App seamlessly integrates these utilities and functionalities to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing application that retrieves and presents weather data from the OpenWeather API. The combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS ensures efficient development, code maintainability, and an exceptional user experience.
